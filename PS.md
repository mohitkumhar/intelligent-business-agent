- AI Business Helper Chatbot for Small Business Owners

---

## The Problem (In Simple Words)

Small business owners run their business every day.  
They have to take many decisions like:

- How much money to spend on ads  
- What price to keep for products  
- Whether to hire a new employee  
- How to manage expenses  
- When to grow or expand  

But most business owners have these problems:

- They do not know if their decision is right or wrong  
- They decide based on guess, emotion, or pressure  
- Their business data is spread in many places (Excel, apps, notebooks)  
- They do not have time or knowledge to analyze numbers  
- No system tells them “Stop, this decision is risky” before they act  

---

## What Happens Because of This

Because of wrong or unclear decisions:

- Money gets wasted  
- Cash problems happen  
- Same mistakes are repeated again and again  
- Business growth becomes slow or unstable  
- Owners feel confused and stressed  

---

## Main Problem (One Line)

Business owners do not have a smart assistant who understands their business and helps them decide what to do before making a mistake.

## What the AI Chatbot Will Do

### 1. Understand the Business

Before the owner does anything, AI will say:

Example:

Decision: Spend ₹10,000 on ads  
Result: Risky  
Suggestion: Start with ₹3,000 test first

AI shows one clear score:

Business Health: 65 / 100

And explains why:

- Expenses are high  
- Sales are slow  
- Cash is limited

### 4. Give Warnings Automatically

AI warns the owner early:
